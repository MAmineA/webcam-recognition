### Installing

First, let install the required libraries

```shell
cd yourDirectory/webcam-recognition/requirements.txt
```

then

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Cool, you got everything ready to run the program

### Train your model

The model is based on [Haar like features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature), hence, you need to train your model.

For this, you need to gather pictures of you and your friends (ask them before). Then put all thoses pictures into separated named folders ìnto the `data` folder.

To train your model to detect Pépito and Paolo, do something like this:

```
data
└───Pepito
│       │   picture1.jpg
│       │   picture2.png
│       │   picture_with_whatever_name_or_classic_format.jpg
│
└───Paolo
│       │   picture1.jpg
│       │   picture2.png
│       │   picture_with_whatever_name_or_classic_format.jpg
```

Nice, it seems you are ready to train your model now.

Ok, then you just have to `cd` to the root of the repository, and run:

```shell
python train_reco.py
```

The prompt will tell you things like:

```
Preparing data...
Training for Pepito, Paolo          # Check if this is ok
Pepito is number 0                  # This is just a mapper for the test_reco.py
[ INFO:0] Initialize OpenCL runtime...   # You just don't care about it
Paolo is number 1
Data prepared
Total faces:  35                    # Here, it will tell you how many faces and label the program found
Total labels:  35
```

#### Train your model - Best Practices

The thing is, Haar is not Google's top neural networks, hence you need to help him to do his work.

* Balance the number of pictures over people to reduce over/under fitting.
  
  Assume Pépito has 30 pictures to train on, and Paolo only 5, you can be sure the model will say everyone is Pépito.


* Crop your pictures to avoid loosing training examples
  
  If the prompt prints this `Impossible to find Paolo`, it means that on a picture, he wasn't able to recognise anyone. Meaning you just lost a training example.


* Avoid twins

Well, because... They are twins.


#### Test your model

You have now the folder `model` filled with two files:
1. `model.xml` : The model :)
2. `dict.pickle` : The mapper, because the model can associate only faces with numbers, this dictionary will map number to faces.

But you don't have to care about it.

Now, let see how the model recognise you:

```shell
python test_reco.py
```

You'll see the webcam fire, and see yourself in a window, with a green box around your face.

Does the model recognises you? If not, you need to train it better, with more and better pictures. 

Thanks for reading.

Sorry for the long post, here a potatoe:
